# ModelTheoryWiki
Using Forester, We are attempting to resurrect and grow the since deleted model theory wiki, and give it a better foundation for future growth. 

# How to use this page:
To view the wiki goto https://conair94.github.io/ModelTheoryWiki/

To edit the wiki, enter the monster-main file, and edit the files in the /trees folder. From here run build.sh and commit the changes to github. Make sure to view your changes before committing to make sure they do not break anything.
