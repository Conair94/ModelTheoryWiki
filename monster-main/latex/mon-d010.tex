\maketitle
\par{
    A model \(M\) has uniform elimination of imaginaries, if, in addition to having elimination of imaginaries, the formula \(\phi\) is independent of \(\bar {a}\) and is dependent only on \(\theta\). 
    
    Equivalently, we can say $M$ has uniform elimination of imaginaries if there is a $0$-definable function \(f\), such that \(f( \bar {a})= \bar {b}\) where \(\bar {b}\) is the unique tuple that defines \(\bar {a}/ \theta\).
