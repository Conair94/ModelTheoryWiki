\maketitle
\par{
    A \emph{deduction rule} has the form \(\frac { \Gamma _1 \vdash  A_1 \quad \cdots \quad \Gamma _n \vdash  A_n}{ \Gamma \vdash  A}\),
    where each \(\Gamma _i \vdash  A_i\) and \(\Gamma \vdash  A\) is a sequent.
    The sequents above the line are called \emph{antecedents}, and the sequent below the line is the \emph{consequent}.
}\par{\emph{Applying} a deduction rule involves having a collection of sequents which match the antecedents,
    and \emph{deducing} the sequent which matches the consequent.
