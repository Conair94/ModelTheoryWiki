\par{Quantifier Elimination is a broader technique in Model Theory where for a structure in a given language, an arbitrary formula can be written as a boolean combination of perhaps simpler formulas}
\begin{tree}{title={Definition of an Elimination Set}, taxon={definition}, slug={BMT-d014}}
An \emph{Elimination Set} for a language \(\mathcal {L}\) and class \(K\) of \(\mathcal {L}\)-structures, then a set \(\Gamma\) of formulas \(\phi\) is an elimination set for \(K\) if for every formula \(\phi ( \bar {x})\) of \(\mathcal {L}\) there is a formula \(\phi ^*( \bar {x})\) which is a boolean combinations of formulas in \(\Gamma\) and \(\phi\) is equivalent to \(\phi ^*\) in every structure in \(K\)
