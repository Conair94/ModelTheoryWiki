\maketitle
\par{Given a topological space \(X\), \(X\) is a Polish space if \(X\) is completely metrisable and seperable}\par{(Seperable = Second Countable = There is a dense, countable set in \(X\))}\par{(Completely metrisable = there is a metric on \(X\) which is complete = there is a metric on \(X\) so that every cauchy sequence 
has a limit)}\par{Closed subsets of Polish spaces are themselves Polish (closed = the restricted metric is complete), Product and sums of topologies of Polish spaces are Polish}
