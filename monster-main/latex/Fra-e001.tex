\maketitle
\par{Rado's famous random graph is indeed the Fraisse Limit of the class of finite graphs in the language \(\mathcal {L} =  \{ E \}\) where \(E\) is a binary relation representing "there is an edge" between two points.}\par{More precisely, a graph is an \(\mathcal {L}-\)structure for which \(E\) is anti-reflexive and symmetric.}
