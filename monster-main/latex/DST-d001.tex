\maketitle
\par{Given a topology, the Borel sets are the sets generated by closing the open sets under complementation and countable union.}\par{A \(G_ \delta\) set is a Borel set formed by a countable intersection of open sets.}\par{A \(F_ \sigma\) set is a Borel set formed by a countable union of closed sets.}\par{(Recall a countable union of open sets is open, and a countable intersection is closed.)}
