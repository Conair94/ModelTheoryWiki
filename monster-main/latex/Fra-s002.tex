\par{We define other common properties and variants of the set up shown in the \ForesterRef{Fra-s001}{Fraisse section}}
\begin{tree}{title={Disjoint Amalgamation Property (dAP)}, taxon={definition}, slug={Fra-d006}}
Given a class and relation \((K, \leq )\), we say that \(K\) has the \emph{Disjoint Amalgamation Property} if for every \(A,B,C  \in  K\) such that \(B \cap  C =A\), if there 
exists an embedding \(f:A \rightarrow  B\) such that \(f(A)  \leq  B\) and and embedding \(g:A \rightarrow  C\) such that \(A \leq  B\), then there exists a structure \(D\) 
and embeddings \(h_1:C \rightarrow  D\) and \(h_2:B \rightarrow  D\) such that \(h_1(C) \leq  D\) and \(h_2(B)  \leq  D\), \(h_2(f(A)) = h_1(g(A))\), and \(h_2(C)  \cap  h_1(B) = h_1(A)\)\par{An example of a class which has the dAP is the \ForesterRef{Fra-e001}{Fraisse class of finite graphs}}\par{An example of a smooth class which does not have the dAP is \ForesterRef{Smc-e001}{The class of initial segments}}
\end{tree}

\begin{tree}{title={Ramsey Class}, taxon={definition}, slug={Fra-d007}}
For structures \(A,B\), let \[\binom {B}{A} =  \{ A_0: A_0 \leq  B & ; A_0 \cong  B \}\]\par{Given a class and relation \((K, \leq )\), we say that \(K\) has the Ramsey property if for every \(A \leq  B  \in  K\), there is some \(C \in  K\) with \(B \leq  C\)
such that for every \(k\)-coloring \(c:  \binom {C}{A} \rightarrow  k\), there is some \(B'  \in   \binom {C}{B}\) with \[c|_{ \binom {B'}{A}}\] constant.}\par{Ramsey classes are highly related to descriptive set theory, in particular, extremely amenable sets.}
