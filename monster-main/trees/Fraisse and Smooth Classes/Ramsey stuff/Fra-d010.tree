\p{Given a class and relation #{(K,\leq)}, we say that #{K} has the indivisibility property on substructures if for every #{A \in K}, there is some #{C\in K}
such that for every #{k}-coloring #{c: C\rightarrow k}, there is some #{A'\leq C} such that #{A' \cong A} with ##{c|_{A'}} constant.}
\p{Indivisibility is a weakening of the Ramsey property. In some explicit cases, RPS implies InvP.}
