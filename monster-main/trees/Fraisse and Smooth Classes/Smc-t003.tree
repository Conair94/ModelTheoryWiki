\p{The first direction of the following theorem first appears in [this paper](\Smc-r001) by Laskowski and Kueker, and the second direction appears in [this thesis](\smc-r003)}
\p{Let #{(K,\leq)} be a smooth class with a generic #{\mathcal{A}}. For every #{A \in K}, there exists some formula #{\sigma(\overline{x})} such that #{\models \forall(\overline{x})(\sigma(\overline{x}) \leftrightarrow \Phi_A(\overline{x}))} (see [here](Smc-d001) for the defintion of $\Phi_A) if and only if #{M} is atomic}
