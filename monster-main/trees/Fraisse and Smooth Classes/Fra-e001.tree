\p{Rado's famous random graph is indeed the Fraisse Limit of the class of finite graphs in the language #{\mathcal{L} = \{E\}} where #{E} is a binary relation representing "there is an edge" between two points.}
\p{More precisely, a graph is an #{\mathcal{L}-}structure for which #{E} is anti-reflexive and symmetric.}
