\p{Given a topology, the Borel sets are the sets generated by closing the open sets under complementation and countable union.}
\p{A #{G_\delta} set is a Borel set formed by a countable intersection of open sets.}
\p{A #{F_\sigma} set is a Borel set formed by a countable union of closed sets.}
\p{(Recall a countable union of open sets is open, and a countable intersection is closed.)}
