\p{The formula #{\varphi(x;y)} has the \em{independence property} if there
are sequences of tuples #{(a_i : i \in \omega)} and
#{(b_S : S \subseteq \omega)} such that for every subset #{S \subseteq \omega}
##{i \in S \Longleftrightarrow \mathbb{M} \models \varphi(a_i; b_S).}}

\p{A language, also called a vocabulary, is a set #{\mathcal{L}} consisting of symbols for constants, relations, and functions, 
often denoted by #{c}, #{R}, and #{f} respectively. Languages may have any cardinality.}
