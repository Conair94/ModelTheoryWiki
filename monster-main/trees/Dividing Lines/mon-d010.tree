\p{
    A model #{M} has uniform elimination of imaginaries, if, in addition to having elimination of imaginaries, the formula #{\phi} is independent of #{\bar{a}} and is dependent only on #{\theta}. 
    
    Equivalently, we can say $M$ has uniform elimination of imaginaries if there is a $0$-definable function #{f}, such that #{f(\bar{a})=\bar{b}} where #{\bar{b}} is the unique tuple that defines #{\bar{a}/\theta}.
