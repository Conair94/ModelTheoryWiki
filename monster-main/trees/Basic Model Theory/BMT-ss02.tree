\p{An \em{Elimination Set} for a language #{\mathcal{L}} and class #{K} of #{\mathcal{L}}-structures, then a set #{\Gamma} of formulas #{\phi} is an elimination set for #{K} if for every formula #{\phi(\bar{x})} of #{\mathcal{L}} there is a formula #{\phi^*(\bar{x})} which is a boolean combinations of formulas in #{\Gamma} and #{\phi} is equivalent to #{\phi^*} in every structure in #{K}}
