\p{We use \em{quantifiers} to bound variables in a formula in first order logic.}
\p{If #{\phi(x)} is a [formula](BMT-d009), then #{\exists x (\phi(x))} should be translated as "there is an interpretation of #{x} such that #{\phi(x)} holds.}
\p{If #{\phi(x)} is a [formula](BMT-d009), then #{\forall x (\phi(x))} should be translated as "for all interpretations of #{x}, #{\phi(x)} holds.}
