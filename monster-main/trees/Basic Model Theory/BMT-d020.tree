\p{Given a [language](BMT-d001), #{\mathcal{L}}, and a [#{\mathcal{L}}-theory #{T}](BMT-d017), a partial type of T, {p(x)}, \em{principal} if there is an #{\mathcal{L}}-formula, #{\varphi(x)}, such that #{\models \exists x \varphi(x)} and for every #{\varpsi(x) \in p(x)} we have that #{\models \forall x (\varphi(x) \rightarrow \varpsi(x))}. In the case that #{p(x)} is complete, we must have that #{\varphi(x)\in p(x)} and the first condition is redundant.}
\p{A complete type of T, {p(x)} is \em{isolated} if it is principal as a partial type. Equivalently, {p(x)} is \em{isolated} if #{\{p(x)\}} is open [S_n(T)](BMT-d021). This coincides with the usual topological terminology.}
