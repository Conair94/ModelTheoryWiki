\p{Dividing lines play a fundamental role in model theory. They form the basis of Shelah's approach to classification theory and have been a central influence on model theory since their conception. Here is an interactive (though not complete) map of the [model theoretic universe](https://forkinganddividing.com), maintained by Gabriel Conant. Important examples of dividing lines include stability, NIP, and o-minimality.}
